# Introduction to Data Science Project

The purpose of this project is to reveal the relationships between diabetes and hypertensin in different age groups and different genders using data obtained from medical cases. The data sets were used in the study is taken from separate sources on Kaggle.

The correlations between various combinations of variables were shown, and then, using the group members' initial findings as a basis, hypotheses were proposed and tested, either confirming or rejecting the hypotheses. In order to determine whether there is a relationship between age groups and genders and how frequently this relationship occurs, machine learning models were created.
